## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- Pre-built binary release for macOS 12 or later on Apple Silicon (`hdrswitch-0.1.2-macos-arm64.zip`).
- `release.sh` to build and package a release zip with a SHA-256 checksum.
- Requirements and install sections in the README, including how to clear the Gatekeeper quarantine flag.

### Changed

- `build.sh` now targets macOS 12, so `hdrctl` runs on macOS 12 or later instead of only the macOS version it was built on.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- `hdrctl` command-line tool to switch HDR, the color profile and the monitor's local dimming in one command (`on`, `off`, `toggle`, `status`).
- Separate commands for each step: `hdr on|off`, `profile <name|path>`, and `ddc dump|get|set` for DDC/CI monitor settings.
- `list` command to show connected displays, their HDR state and current profile.
- `--display`, `--hdr-profile` and `--sdr-profile` options.
- `m27p6s-hdr.sh` wrapper with KTC M27P6S defaults, configurable through `DISPLAY_NAME`, `HDR_PROFILE` and `SDR_PROFILE`.
- Local dimming control for the KTC M27P6S through vendor VCP code `0xF4` (`0` = Off, `2` = Standard), with read-back and retry while the monitor is busy.
- Safety checks before any DDC write: EDID manufacturer, product ID and name, display controller ID, firmware version and the `0xF4` range must match the mapped monitor, or the tool exits without changing anything.
- `ddc set` limited to `0xF4` with values `0` or `2`.
- `build.sh` to build `hdrctl` with the Xcode Command Line Tools.
